1)Simple algorithmic based RS--imdb uses
2)Content based recommendation system-- It recommends movie to the user based on the content.content may be any like (based on director,actor,story).
3)Collaborative filtering--it combines users of same type based on the ratings they gave for the movies and recommend articles based on them(i.e,)recommend article to one user based on what other user of his same type has watched.
4)Hybrid filtering--# It's a combination of other filtering method
